# Demo for `catalogist`

> Catalogist is the easy way to catalog and make your software and (micro)services visible to your organization in a lightweight and developer-friendly way.

Shows a very basic example of using [catalogist](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/catalogist) in a GitHub Action pipeline; see `.github/workflows/catalogist.yml`.

## Configuration

You would need to set a `ENDPOINT` secret to your Catalogist endpoint for the Action script to actually work.
